# Master Thesis
The topic of this Master thesis is the <u> Data based modeling of Integro-Differential Equations </u>. Exemplary Equations can be found in the context of cell populations and/or crystal population models.

First such equations are solved numerically (using python). The solution is a population model n(m,t). In the next step it is attempted to recreate the system dynamics using a model-based approach.
This can be realized using **neural networks**, **DMD** or other Data based methods. the "real" DGL is then simply used for verification.
